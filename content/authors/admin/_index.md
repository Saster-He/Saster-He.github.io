    summary: |
      I conducted a hypothesis test for differential gene expression of single cell RNA sequencing where gene level variability was defined as the test measure. I also wrote R functions to address the mean-variance relationship for zero-inflated RNA-seq counts (32,738 genes and 2,692 cells).

I am a researcher interested in clinical trial design and statistical methods that support the analysis of longitudinal, multicenter, and high-dimensional data. My work focuses on building computational tools and frameworks that help both statisticians and clinicians draw reliable insights from complex, large-scale health data. I also aspire to be an effective educator who shares her enthusiasm for statistics and biomedical research with others.
